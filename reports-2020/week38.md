## Jet
### v4.3 - First week of Oct
**Timing:** 8 weeks in, 1 weeks to go
1 development spring (1 week) added to the release cycle.
Scope of **v4.3** finalized. Feature overview:
 - **Benchmarking and tuning** - we tuned Jet to impressive performance, latency wise. This tuning will be available as well as clearly described benchmarks, parameters and mapping to real-world use-cases.
 - **Unified API for processing file-based data.** Seems fundamental and it really is. It raises a convenience to process data from files, structured or textual and load it into Hazelcast.
 - **Increased resilience:** Jobs made more robust against remote system failures and programmer errors. Job creates a “failure recovery point” if errors are experienced, giving users a space to fix it and resume.
 - **Sorting:** Again - basic operation that was missing until now.
 - **HTTP Connector:** You can call a REST endpoint in Jet for data ingestion. Great for evaluating and simple integrations.
 - **Sparse events:** Jet has can process time-series data. As such, time in Jet ticks just if the data arrive. But what the if data stream stops for a while? Time stops as well. Some outputs of Jet might get postponed, leading to unwanted latencies. We’re fixing this for some cases.
 - **Unified Management Center:** Jet can cluster can now be managed and monitored using the same tool as Hazelcast IMDG uses
